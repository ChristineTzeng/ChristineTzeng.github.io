  <h2> Norm and Emotion-aware Cognitive Systems</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <h3> Abstract: </h3>
    <p>
      With advances in technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become part of our daily lives.
      Different from the past, the software is no longer limited to confined and isolated environments.
      Nowadays, software interacts with its environment but also with each other and with humans.
      With humans-in-the-loop, there are emerging needs for human factors to be considered when building modern AI systems. 
      Specifically, these AI systems should reason over humans' behaviors determined by internal attitudes and external factors.
      Human values help to explain behaviors and attitudes from a motivational basis.
      Specifically, human values define an individual's intrinsic motivation and dominate how this individual thinks and evaluates everything. 
      AI that considers human values and sociotechnical aspects in decision-making would be more realistic and trustworthy.
      <br>
      Another concern that arises from socio-technical systems is adaptability.
      In human societies, norms are expectations of individual behaviors, which can be established or revised from the top-down or emerge from the bottom-up.
      Norms from the top-down approach, such as laws, are defined by a centralized authority.
      On the contrary, norms can also emerge from the bottom up via agent interactions.
      In both approaches, norms and the environment can change over time.
      While introduced to multiagent systems (Normative MAS), social norms act as behavioral constraints that regulate agent behaviors within MAS.
      To reduce human interventions, the ability of adaptation for AI systems becomes necessary.
      <br>
      By regulating agent interactions, norms facilitate coordination in MAS. 
      Sanctions, the reactions to norm satisfaction or norm violation, have guided research on norms for a long time.
      Current research on norms focuses on how sanctioning shapes agents' behaviors, specifically on the santionees.
      Little research on norm emergence has incorporated values, which determine how agents behave and how they assess each other's behavior.
      Sanctions in the real world are often more subtle than mere rewards or punishments.
      In particular, verbal messages or expressed emotions also serve as sanctions.
      We include emotions into the normative reasoning process, which evaluate whether to comply or violate norms.
      In addition, we consider expressed emotions as information.
      Normative information can be conveyed in explicit messages or emotional expressions, which other works have not considered.
      While humans evaluate social norms based on their values, they are flexible in accepting exceptions.
      Previous work on conflict resolution reveal all information to others.
      We propose work on providing deliberate justifications.

    <h3> Approaches: </h3>
    <p>
      In this dissertation, we propose 
      <ul>
        <li>(1) Noe, a framework that integrates the BDI architecture with normative reasoning and emotion modeling. 
      We consider emotions as a sanctioning approach. </li>
        <li>(2) Hermione, a framework that integrates reinforcement learning with normative reasoning, cognitive architecture, and emotion modeling.
      We consider expressed emotions as normative information.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2> Proposed Work: </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Humans evaluate social norms based on human values. 
          Most previous works related to norms did not consider values and assumed regimented environments.
          In the real world, humans with varied weights of values evaluate the outcomes of their actions subjectively and act to maximize their utility.
          Besides, However, interacting with someone else is inevitable while living in a society.
          Like fundamental human values, social value orientation (SVO) indicates a person's preference for resource allocation between self and others.
          We propose a framework  to reason over human values and SVO.
        </li>
        <li>
          While humans evaluate social norms based on their values, they are flexible in accepting exceptions.
          Previous work on conflict resolution reveal all information to others.
          We propose work on providing deliberate justifications.
        </li>
      </ul>
